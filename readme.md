### Github Corners

Phew, Github is over seven years old now... and is unquestionably synonymous with open source. After 7 years, those GitHub ribbons are more than overdue for a cleaner, more modern alternative. [This is my take.](http://tholman.com/github-corners)

By using SVG, these corners can be clean and sharp. Any color, and size. As well as have a little character and interactivity!
  
You can build your own with the [SVG's](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners/tree/master/svg), or copy some of the pre-defined code.

### Screenshot

You can see the page here ... but I really recommend [visiting the page](http://tholman.com/github-corners) to see the small animations that really make them come to life.
