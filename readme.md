### GitHub Corners

Phew, GitHub is over ten years old now... and is unquestionably synonymous with open source. After 10 years, those GitHub ribbons are more than overdue for a cleaner, more modern alternative. [This is my take.](http://tholman.com/github-corners)

By using SVG, these corners can be clean and sharp. Any color, and size. As well as have a little character and interactivity!

You can build your own with the [SVGs](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners/tree/master/svg), copy some of the pre-defined code, or just change the `fill` and `color` values on the main `<svg>` element. There's also a nifty little customizer at the bottom of the page, too!

### Screenshot

You can see the page here... but I really recommend [visiting the page](http://tholman.com/github-corners) to see the small animations that really make them come to life.
